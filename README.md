**Welcome to the Satellite Unconference at the Helmholtz AI conference 2024, June 12, 2024, Düsseldorf ([Full program]())!**

Fuel your curiosity and kick off the excitement! Join us for a dynamic unconference, a satellite event right before the conference begins, where innovation knows no bounds. Don't miss this unique opportunity to engage, collaborate, and set the tone for an unforgettable conference experience.

Unconferences are participant-driven events where the attendees decide the topics and shape the agenda. Here, we believe in the collective power of bright minds coming together to spark innovation and inspire change.

## Tips

📜 Comment on existing issues if you have any thoughts or questions about it. You can also mention how you could contribute or anything else relevant to the idea.

📜 Use the unconference issue template to put your abstract in the right shape - we need information such as a session title, description, responsible persons, timeframe and so on.

📜 Please make sure that your session ideas are understandable to everyone. We come from different fields. Use as little jargon as possible. 💁

🗣️ At the beginning of the unconference we will have an introduction session where all session organizers will have the chance to pitch their project idea and to guide people to their session. Prepare yourself for a <1 min pitch.

👍 Please vote on project ideas/issues that you consider interesting.

📜 Please add a short summary about the outcome of your session to the open git issue, e.g., specify specific results, link to documents you worked on, specify goals for future collaboration you agreed on.
